During some downtime last year, I decided to test the waters with Behavior-driven development. I had seen other people write BrainFuck interpreters in Code Golfs on StackOverflow and figured this was a nice way to learn.

This is the result of it. The interpreter itself has most of the functionality working, but there are edge cases that were not accounted for. Use this as a learning tool.

Cheers,
